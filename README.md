# SoccerLeagues

App created in MVP using TheSportsDB API, allowing to search for a soccer league, then browse through teams, and select a team to see all the players and their details.

Note: looking up all players for a team is not provided for free by the API anymore. This will cause the app to display an empty tableView when trying to display a team's players.
